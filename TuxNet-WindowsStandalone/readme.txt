TuxNet Windows Standalone

To install, run 'TuxNet-WindowsStandaloneInstaller.exe' in the TuxNet-MacStandalone directory. You will be prompted to choose a directory where TuxNet will be installed and to install MATLAB Runtime if it is not already installed.

Note that you will need to install ea-utils, hisat2, SAMtools, and Cufflinks before using the TUX tab. Once installed, rename these folders to ea-utils, hisat2, samtools, and cufflinks, respectively, and move them into the same folder that TuxNet.app and the other TuxNet files are located: '<TuxNetLocation>/application'.

To run TuxNet, run 'TuxNet.app' in the 'application' folder, located in the folder you chose for TuxNet to be installed in. You will be prompted to choose the current working directory via a file finder: '<TuxNetLocation>/application' should be your selection.
