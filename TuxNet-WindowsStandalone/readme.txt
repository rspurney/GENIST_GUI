TuxNet Windows Standalone

To install, run 'TuxNet-WindowsStandaloneInstaller.exe' in the TuxNet-WindowsStandalone directory. You will be prompted to choose a directory where TuxNet will be installed and to install MATLAB Runtime if it is not already installed.

Note that the Windows version of TuxNet cannot run the modified Tuxedo pipeline.

To run TuxNet, run 'TuxNet.exe' in the 'application' folder, located in the folder you chose for TuxNet to be installed in. You will be prompted to choose the current working directory via a file finder: '<TuxNetLocation>/application' should be your selection.
