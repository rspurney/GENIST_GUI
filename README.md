# TuxNet
Matlab App to process raw RNA-seq data and infer GRNs from the processed data.

The use of TuxNet requires a 64-bit computer running Mac OS X (10.4 Tiger or later), with Matlab installed (R2017b ONLY).

GENIE3, available from https://github.com/jmlingeman/Network-Inference-Workspace/tree/master/algorithms/genie3, must be also installed before RTP-STAR can be run using TuxNet. To install GENIE3, download the MATLAB .zip folder, unzip the files, and follow the installation instructions included in the documentation.

HISAT2, available from https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/hisat2/index.shtml, must be installed before the TUX tab of the HISAT2 version of TuxNet can be run. To install HISAT2, download the correct binary and follow the installation instructions included in the documentation.

To run TuxNet, download all the files from this folder as a .zip folder, and unzip the folder. To run TuxNet for the first time using Arabidopsis data, unzip genome.fa.zip (included in the folder). Then open the TuxNet.mlapp file, included in the folder.   

Details to run the software are provided in the following manuscript:
TuxNet: A simple interface to process RNA sequencing data and infer gene regulatory networks.
